			<p class="description">Geographic Information System used to display and locate on a map the social care resources of the regional government. The system was composed of a series of web pages developed using JSP that interfaced with several web services at the backend. These web services then communicated with a GeoServer GIS server connected to a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS spatial extensions to extract the geographical information. Later the project was extended to support Oracle and Oracle Spatial as the database engine.<br/>
			My role on the project was the choice of the technological platform, specification, design and development of the whole application.</p>
